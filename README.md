## About Tree
This simple C program uses "for loops" to create automatic trees drawings.

## How it works

To recreate those trees in C we will be using slash and backslash (/ and \) for layers. Each layer is a bit taller than it is wide, so the trees themselves 
are also taller than they are wide.

## Using Tree

This program allows the user to decide just how tall the trees should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between 1 and 20, inclusive.

Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 20 when prompted:

```
$ ./tree
Height: 20
                   /\
                  //\\
                 ///\\\
                ////\\\\
               /////\\\\\
              //////\\\\\\
             ///////\\\\\\\
            ////////\\\\\\\\
           /////////\\\\\\\\\
          //////////\\\\\\\\\\
         ///////////\\\\\\\\\\\
        ////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\
       /////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\
      //////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
     ///////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
    ////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
   /////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
  //////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
 ///////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
////////////////////\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
```
Here’s how the program might work if the user inputs 4 when prompted:

```
$ ./tree
Height: 4
   /\
  //\\
 ///\\\
////\\\\
```
